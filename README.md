Project Summary: Spam Mail Prediction

Objective: The project aims to build a predictive model to classify emails as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

1.The dataset used for this project is loaded from a CSV file (mail_data.csv).
2.The dataset is examined for its structure, dimensions, and descriptive statistics.
3.Missing values are handled by replacing them with empty strings to ensure the dataset is complete for processing.

Feature Extraction:

1.Text data is transformed into numerical features using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer. This technique converts the raw email content into a matrix of numerical values, which can be processed by machine learning algorithms.

Model Building:

1.A logistic regression model is used for predicting whether an email is spam or not. Logistic regression is chosen due to its effectiveness in binary classification problems.
The dataset is split into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Evaluation:

3.The accuracy of the model is evaluated using the test set. The model's performance is measured by comparing the predicted labels against the actual labels in the test data.
The evaluation metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify spam and non-spam emails.

Outcome:

The project concludes with the model achieving a 96% level of accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting spam emails. The accuracy score is used as the key performance indicator for the model.
